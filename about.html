				<h2>The <span class="companyName">Spaghetti & Cruft</span> Story</h2>
				<p>
				Gotham, California has attracted, for some reason or another, a large number of computer software companies and internet-based enterprises. Many of their offices are concentrated in the city's trendy Riverbend district, drawn perhaps to the neighborhood's empty warehouses and lofts that have been remodeled into hip and nearly affordable office spaces. These companies employ a great many smart and talented people, and those people need to eat.

				<p>
				Recognizing the demand for good food at fair prices in this booming part of town, two brothers, Mario and Salvador, opened a neighborhood pizzeria in 1999. Business was good and their reputation grew, but things really took off when the brothers had the brilliant notion of catering to the neighborhood geeks, the designers and developers busily building new pieces of the World Wide Web. The brothers brought in comfy couches to complement the red-checkered tablecloths, installed an array of wireless routers to provide free broadband connectivity for their customers, and even tracked down a vintage Asteroids arcade machine. They changed the name of their eatery from Mario and Sal's Pizza to <span class=”companyName”>Spaghetti & Cruft Geek Pizzeria</span>.

				At <span class="companyName">Spaghetti & Cruft Geek Pizzeria</span>, we handcraft our pizzas on the spot using only the best ingredients, and then bake them to perfection in our rustic wood-fired brick oven. We sell pizza by the slice or by the pie and even offer catering for any occasion all around the neighborhood.
				</p>
				<p>
				Our broad menu of pasta dishes puts a modern twist on Old Italia, served in heaping bowlfuls sure to satisfy any appetite (though we bet you'll want seconds anyway!). But it's not all noodles and crust at <span class=”companyName”>Spaghetti & Cruft Geek Pizzeria</span>; we also have fresh veggie sides, an all-you-can-eat salad bar, and the best cannolis in town!
